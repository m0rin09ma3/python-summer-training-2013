[19:03:11] <sankha87_> !
[19:03:18] <praveenkumar> sankha87_: pushd create the stack and keep the track of it when you do popd then it will remove the item from that stack.
[19:03:22] <Ravi_pro> kushal, thanks

[19:08:57] <praveenkumar> s/and/as
[19:09:05] <zishan> arin, the function of -p is to make multiple directries at the same time

[19:12:39] <zishan> sankha87, ascii mode in terminal is simply called text mode
[19:12:49] <PleaseSTART> !
[19:13:09] <zishan> sankha87, terminal only supports text mode
[19:13:18] <Christina> zishan just said -p is used to make multiple directories but that can be done using mkdir a/b/c/d and so on
[19:13:52] <zishan> chandankumar, i have tried the same but can't do that
[19:13:56] <Christina> What difference does adding -p make
[19:14:01] <Christina> <EOF>
[19:14:06] <kushal> Christina, for your example all a b c should be already there
[19:14:19] <kushal> Christina, first try mkdir x/y/z
[19:14:32] <kushal> and then mkdir -p x/y/z
[19:14:48] <arin> Christina you mean it can be used without -p?
[19:15:05] <Christina> kushal, understood :) thanks
[19:15:30] <zishan> Christina, arin , it can't be used without -p
[19:15:34] <Christina> arin, no not at all was trying to figure out the difference

[19:16:33] <kushal> PleaseSTART, when you use rm , it just deletes :)
[19:16:41] <PleaseSTART> can we retrieve it from terminal?
[19:16:52] <kushal> PleaseSTART, no
[19:17:00] <dot_not> (At least not easily.)
[19:17:15] <PleaseSTART> is there any backup option?
[19:17:28] <dot_not> Not included with the rm command.

[19:22:48] <elita15> <eof>
[19:22:49] <J_Caselles> cat < text.txt is the same as cat text.txt, right? all the examples on the book regarding < are redundant; could you point us some case "<" would be useful?
[19:22:56] <kushal> elita15, type the exact sam words in google.com
[19:23:28] <kushal> J_Caselles, let me think a nice example
[19:23:53] <anurag> !

[19:34:40] <J_Caselles> nice thanks
[19:34:47] <Zubin> what I meant is suppose  we need to go to location c:/user/zubin/downloads/wake/up/lol in windows we need to use cd user/zubin/downloads/wake/up/lol.
[19:34:48] <lakshya> kushal ohh :D
[19:34:54] <Christina> somehow cd . . is not working
[19:35:00] <Christina> <EOF>
[19:35:08] <kushal> Zubin, stop discussing windows stuff or else I will just kick you out
[19:35:16] <zishan> Christina, its not cd . . is cd ..
[19:35:26] <Zubin> ok ok ok.

[19:38:10] <kushal> PleaseSTART, you have to talk to people to find a mentor
[19:38:27] <dot_not> anurag: Because commands to him start with a point.
[19:38:28] <PleaseSTART> how?
[19:38:33] <kushal> anurag, anything starting with . is a command to him
[19:38:42] <anurag> cool.
[19:38:44] <praveenkumar> anurag: batul is a bot and it's programmed that way.
[19:39:01] <praveenkumar> .ls

[19:43:48] <Christina> how to save todays log using xchat
[19:43:49] <kushal> Christina, Settings->Preferences->Logging tick to enable, then everything will be logged
[19:43:59] <elita15> !
[19:44:01] <kushal> if you did that earlier then it is already saved
[19:44:05] <kushal> elita15, ask

[19:45:38] <puspita> <eof>

[19:46:41] <J_Caselles> !
[19:47:02] <Christina> kushal, Thank you i hope i haven't irritated you with my questions
[19:47:11] <kushal> Christina, nope
[19:47:14] <kushal> J_Caselles, ask
[19:47:18] <dot_not> !
[19:47:22] <kushal> dot_not, ask
[19:47:23] <elita15> kushal, i tried but couldn't find. can we create share folders on ubuntu?
[19:47:31] <kushal> elita15, yes
[19:47:45] <kushal> elita15, search and read about NFS
[19:47:52] <J_Caselles> exact diference between Free Open Source and just Open Source?
[19:48:05] <dot_not> FHS will be the topic of the first class. What will be the topic of the second class?
[19:48:15] <J_Caselles> free Software and Open Software
[19:48:31] <kushal> dot_not, second session will be a review session by mbuf, he will talk with the students
[19:48:48] <kushal> J_Caselles, great questions
[19:48:52] <dot_not> Thanks. Oh, and <EOF>
[19:48:57] <kushal> J_Caselles, wait
[19:48:58] <dot_not> kushal, may I answer it?
[19:49:04] <kushal> dot_not, go ahead
[19:49:41] <dot_not> The difference between "Free Software" and "Open Source Software" is, generally, that you are allowed to use Free Software without charge.
[19:49:50] <dot_not> But you are not allowed to alter or modify it.
[19:50:09] <dot_not> Whereas open source software generally means that you may modify it as you wish.
[19:50:43] <dot_not> This is not the easiest topic because "Free Software" like the FSF (Free Software Foundation) sees it is MUCH different to what the general public sees as free software.
[19:50:50] <dot_not> You should definitely read into it via Google.
[19:50:54] <J_Caselles> ok
[19:50:54] <dot_not> It's a very interesting topic.
[19:51:17] <kushal> J_Caselles, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software
[19:51:27] <J_Caselles> it was regarding "Open source guys are comfortable with mixing proprietary as well as open source code; Free Software is different from Open Source"
[19:51:31] <kushal> read the links for Free software and OSS from there
[19:51:32] <Christina> !
[19:51:37] <kushal> Christina, ask
[19:52:16] <Christina> i couldn't find ~/.xchat/xchatlogs/directory
[19:52:38] <kushal> Christina, how you tried to find it ?
[19:52:45] <Christina> yes
[19:52:59] <kushal> Christina, how you tried to find it ?
[19:53:05] <shantanu> may i answer?
[19:53:16] <Christina> yes kushal
[19:53:35] <kushal> Christina, yes is not the answer of how ?
[19:53:41] <tenstormavi> Christina, May be the folder is hidden, just try ctrl+h. May be you find it.
[19:54:06] <kushal> Christina, yes/no is binary answer, they can be used to a question where I am asking how ?
[19:54:25] <kushal> Christina, how you tried to find that directory ?
[19:54:54] <Christina> Oh i am sorry went to where i installed xchat and looked for all the files
[19:55:17] <Christina> well i hope i am not wrong
[19:55:28] <kushal> Christina, I gave you the exact path to look
[19:55:37] <kushal> go to terminal and ls on that directory
[19:55:47] <kushal> then you can use less on the particular file
[19:55:55] <Christina> Using windows
[19:56:10] <kushal> Christina, heh, no meaning of these sessions then
[19:56:25] <Christina> :( what
[19:56:40] <kushal> Christina, we are teaching about Linux, not windows
[19:56:50] <Zubin> Christina, or goto >setting>preferences>logging> click open data folder.
[19:57:09] <elita15> !
[19:57:14] <kushal> elita15, ask
[19:57:19] <Christina> kushal i know i use linux on vmware so didn't install on it
[19:57:40] <PleaseSTART> Christina please follow Zubin for your query.
[19:57:42] <kushal> Christina, you are supposed to use Linux for the training, not windows
[19:57:56] <kushal> PleaseSTART, Zubin both of you stop
[19:58:02] <kushal> the issue is different
[19:58:18] <PleaseSTART> :P
[19:58:23] <PleaseSTART> Ok..
[19:58:24] <Zubin> what did I do?
[19:58:29] <Christina> Thank you kushal and yes i will be using Linux only but on vmware will it do
[19:58:42] <elita15> besides using the command " sudo apt-get install vim vim-gtk" do we require any other command to install pluggins?
[19:58:43] <kushal> Christina, yes, it will do
[19:59:03] <kushal> Christina, you can install xchat inside there in linux
[19:59:50] <elita15> <eof>
