[13:53:18] <kushal> tanvi, if you google you will get a link to http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-7.html
[13:53:23] <kushal> tanvi, read it
[13:53:29] <kushal> rahulch, lakshya ask
[13:53:56] <tenstormavi> !
[13:53:56] <lakshya> kushal,what r automounted drives

[13:54:07] <kushal> lakshya, are not r
[13:54:11] <rahulch> kushal, what is the difference between / and /root?
[13:54:13] <rahulch> <EOF>
[13:54:29] <kushal> lakshya, drives that get mounted automatically, you don't have to do it manually
[13:54:31] <lakshya> kushal,sorry :(]\
[13:54:58] <PleaseSTART> !
[13:55:00] <kushal> rahulch, / is the root directory of the filesystem, /root is the home directory of the "root"/superuser
[13:55:02] <piotrektt> rahulch, / is a main directory. root is a user. and folder /root has filest taht only root can acess.
[13:55:18] <kushal> arcolife, bidisha tenstormavi ask
[13:55:20] <lakshya> kushal , please give some examples
[13:55:24] <tenstormavi>  how can we  read anything from hard disk or from dvd using /dev?
[13:55:30] <rahulch> kushal, okay got it :)
[13:55:37] <kushal> arin, ask
[13:55:38] <bidisha> When I did $ ls -l /mnt it shows 0 in total why?
[13:55:41] <praveenkumar> lakshya: you flash drive.
[13:55:52] <praveenkumar> s/ you / your /
[13:55:54] <batul> What praveenkumar meant to say was: lakshya: your flash drive.
[13:55:56] <piotrektt> tenstormavi, in linux to read files from a device you need to mount it in a direcotry
[13:55:57] <kushal> bidisha, as nothing is mounted in your system
[13:55:58] <arin> in the command / dev you said we will find a driver named as dvd but in my system i dint find it instead i got disc. are the the same?
[13:56:00] <puspita> !
[13:56:03] <arin> <eof>
[13:56:03] <umesh> lakshya, pen drive, cd/dvd

[13:57:19] <kushal> PleaseSTART, puspita rahulch
[13:57:29] <kushal> ask
[13:57:32] <puja12> !
[13:57:34] <rahulmishra> !
[13:57:40] <praveenkumar> tenstormavi: check "man mount"
[13:58:01] <rahulch> the lost+found folder in the root directory, is it only for the root user?
[13:58:02] <puspita> could you please elaborate on RAMFs.
[13:58:09] <puspita> <eof>
[13:58:16] <rahulch> <EOF>
[13:58:20] <tenstormavi> kushal, praveenkumar thanks.
[13:58:21] <siddhant> !
[13:58:25] <piotrektt> tenstormavi, yes read the man moun because it has a lot to explain
[13:58:32] <rashmi> !
[13:58:44] <elita15> !
[13:58:48] <kushal> puspita, learn to use the shiny new site called google.com
[13:58:52] <kushal> puspita, https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt
[13:58:56] <tenstormavi> piotrektt, thanks.
[13:59:26] <kushal> rahulch, anything under root directory is generally for super user
[13:59:31] <anurag> !
[13:59:47] <umesh> !
[13:59:52] <kushal> Christina, puja12 ask
[13:59:56] <Christina> pendrives cd's are automounted so do you have any example of drives that need to be mounted manually
[13:59:59] <puja12> what is the purpose of lost+found under root directory?
[14:00:10] <rahulch> !
[14:00:14] <piotrektt> Christina, they are not automonted
[14:00:15] <puja12> <eof>
[14:00:31] <kushal> Christina, say if you have two harddrives in your computer
[14:00:32] <lakshya_> actually i was confused
[14:00:33] <dot|not> pujal: Please google that.
[14:00:48] <kushal> puja12, ^^
[14:00:48] <piotrektt> there is a slight difference, because to automont you need to specify the mount command in /etc/fstab file
[14:00:54] <dot|not> "lost found linux" gives you plenty of results.
[14:00:55] <lakshya_> as i read in wikipedia of mounting that in linux one has to mount the drives autmatically
[14:00:55] <PleaseSTART> what are these term define in linux like root, swap, mount etc? If we use linux in VMware then what type of things we will get at terminal?
[14:01:36] <kushal> PleaseSTART, that is also a linux, same thing, no difference from your point of view
[14:01:52] <kushal> siddhant, rashmi elita15 ask
[14:01:56] <siddhant> when i put the pendrive in my laptop i didnot find anything in /media why is it so there is nothing in the /media it is empty why is it so?
[14:01:58] <rashmi> can we make changes in folders other than /usr?
[14:02:13] <kushal> siddhant, which distro ?
[14:02:20] <lakshya_> kushal !
[14:02:23] <elita15> there is nothing in   /opt directory , why is it so?
[14:02:32] <kushal> rashmi, as root user you can change to any directory
[14:02:36] <dot|not> elita15, check out what /opt is for.
[14:02:41] <dot|not> This should explain it to you.
[14:02:54] <rashmi> is / bin and /usr/bin same?
[14:03:05] <kushal> anurag, umesh rahulch ask
[14:03:19] <anurag> RAMFs is supposed to be listed in /dev, right ?
[14:03:20] <kushal> rashmi, in the latest Fedora systems, it is same
[14:03:28] <PleaseSTART> <EOF>
[14:03:42] <rahulch> whatever configuration files are there in /boot, will they also be available in /etc?
[14:03:43] <kushal> anurag, only the devices are listed (if any)
[14:03:44] <rahulch> <EOF>
[14:03:48] <siddhant> kushal,as in log it is said that we can see all the removable devices like pendrive in /media.then why it is not there i mean to say
[14:03:58] <umesh> siddhant, go to run then in media
[14:04:08] <kushal> siddhant, which Linux distribution you are using ?
[14:04:10] <rashmi> any change in /bin will be transmitted to /usr/bin?
[14:04:10] <praveenkumar> rahulch: no
[14:04:35] <umesh> kushal, can we change the color codes through gui ?
[14:04:36] <kushal> lakshya_, ask
[14:04:40] <lakshya_> i read in wikipedia of mounting that in linux one has to mount the drives manually so how come the concept of automount occur in linux
[14:04:41] <umesh> <eof>
[14:05:02] <rashmi> <eof>
[14:05:06] <kushal> lakshya_, man fstab
[14:05:13] <praveenkumar> rashmi: do a 'ls -l' on / directory, you will understand
[14:05:28] <pratikkumar> !
[14:05:29] <elita15> !
[14:05:30] <kushal> siddhant, which Linux distribution you are using ?
[14:05:38] <kushal> pratikkumar, elita15 ask

[14:05:43] <prikotiyal> !
[14:05:46] <rahulch> praveenkumar: ok.
[14:06:16] <kushal> siddhant, in latest Fedora system they get mounted under /run/media/username/ and then somewhere
[14:06:18] <rashmi> thank you
[14:06:25] <pratikkumar> what is the purpose of /sda in /dev ?
[14:06:36] <piotrektt> kushal, it's also true for ubuntu
[14:06:40] <siddhant> kushal,ok thank you :)
[14:06:54] <wiki> kushal: !
[14:06:55] <shantanu> pratikkumar, /sda is you hard disk
[14:06:55] <kushal> piotrektt, thanks for telling that, never knew
[14:07:01] <elita15> shouldn't there be software packages in opt directory which are not part of default installation? can you explain what exactly is stored in opt directory?
[14:07:02] <piotrektt> kushal, oh no sorry it's actually /media/username
[14:07:29] <piotrektt> i've missed the /run
[14:07:44] <kushal> elita15, unless you install anything there, it will be empty, it is like a water bottle, unless you fill it up, there will be no water inside
[14:08:09] <kushal> pratikkumar, again learn to use google.com
[14:08:11] <kushal> pratikkumar, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA

[14:08:44] <kushal> ask
[14:08:48] <nilanjit> !
[14:08:50] <wiki> am i in wrong class? or it was supposed to be Linux rather then a python class?
[14:09:19] <praveenkumar> wiki: today session about FHS.
[14:09:22] <kushal> wiki, you are in right class, but we start from beginning and then slowly move into Python
[14:09:23] <prikotiyal> kushal, what does  "services specific data" means?
[14:09:26] <umesh> !
[14:09:41] <kushal> prikotiyal, where you found that text ?
[14:09:44] <elita15> kushal, i did install many softwares. do you mean that only softwares which are downloaded directly from net  and installed are listed in opt directory?
[14:09:50] <siddhant> pratikkumar,it is explained clearly about /sda in logs first go through completely the log then question here
[14:09:54] <kushal> prikotiyal, can be data related to a system service
[14:09:57] <elita15> <EOF>
[14:10:25] <wiki> kushal: okay i got it!
[14:10:27] <praveenkumar> elita15: no, it's depend of the upstream where he want to put the files.
[14:10:34] <prikotiyal> kushal, under the definition of /serv
[14:10:43] <kushal> elita15, /opt is generally for isv applications which follow their own packaging/paths, or you install them manually
[14:11:21] <kushal> prikotiyal, and you wrote wrong path :D
[14:11:32] <lakshya_> kushal,i cant move to the fstab drectory??

[14:12:14] <prikotiyal> kushal: sorry
[14:12:20] <dot|not> lakshya_, stab is no directory. It's a file.
[14:12:22] <kushal> prikotiyal, search for linux system services
[14:12:25] <dot|not> *fstab
[14:12:28] <prikotiyal> bidisha: thank you

[14:13:05] <kushal> umesh ask
[14:13:07] <nilanjit> <eof>
[14:13:18] <prikotiyal> kushal: thank you
[14:13:30] <praveenkumar> lakshya_: that's a configuration file which suppose to be /etc, you can move it but after that your stuff won't work.
[14:13:31] <umesh> kushal, can we change the color codes through gui ?
[14:13:32] <kushal> nilanjit, yes, your linux OS is actually helping you to do so
[14:13:42] <umesh> <EOF>
[14:13:57] <rahulmishra> !

[14:15:00] <kushal> prikotiyal, rahulmishra ask
[14:15:27] <umesh> kushal, etc/DIR_COLOUR
[14:15:27] <anurag> !
[14:15:27] <prikotiyal> kushal: in the logs it is written that while rebooting the system all files in /tmp should be deleted.Why?
[14:15:41] <rahulmishra> kushal, in /dev i got so many ram, i dont really follow it? are there so many ram?
[14:15:43] <kushal> umesh, it is a text file, means you can change it through any text editor
[14:16:16] <umesh> kushal, yes but i am not able to save it
[14:16:17] <puspita> +1 rahulmishra
[14:16:17] <kushal> prikotiyal, as it is a temporary directory, when we reboot we can remove all temporary things
[14:16:17] <sonam_> !
[14:16:39] <kushal> rahulmishra, what do you mean by so many ram ?
[14:16:53] <kushal> rahulmishra, $ free -m
[14:17:08] <tenstormavi>  kushal you forgot to give the pdf yesterday.
[14:17:08] <kushal> that command tells you your ram details
[14:17:08] <J_Caselles> rahulmishra: it's expalined in the log itself...
[14:17:23] <prikotiyal> kushal: is it necessary to delete it.What is the problem if we don't?
[14:17:29] <kushal> tenstormavi, no, people should learn to use google.com
[14:17:34] <rahulmishra> J_Caselles, okay.
[14:17:37] <tenstormavi> kushal, ok
[14:17:49] <umesh> kushal, i tried through terminal in su mode it worked there but through gui its not working
[14:17:52] <kushal> umesh, you need to be superuser to write under /etc
[14:18:28] <kushal> elita15, anurag  sonam ask
[14:18:41] <sonam_> when i installed fedora 18 the memory gor mounted,after thant some problem was arised,in google i found that one have to distribute memory manually.why so??
[14:19:04] <kushal> sonam, memory or hard drive ?
[14:19:14] <kushal> sonam, where are you from ?
[14:19:22] <sonam_> kushal,hard drive
[14:19:25] <umesh> kushal, so we cannot change those files without using terminal?
[14:19:56] <kushal> sonam_, try to find someone locally who can help you to install
[14:19:57] <praveenkumar> umesh: as in gui you logged in as normal user which don't have permission
[14:20:03] <sonam_> purulia,west bengal
[14:20:04] <elita15> can we access the home directory of superuser?
[14:20:11] <kushal> umesh, for now you can not, later you will find how
[14:20:16] <piotrektt> umesh, to edit from gui just start your editor in superuser mode
[14:20:31] <kushal> elita15, yes, just become superuser
[14:20:32] <sonam_> kushal,i have installed
[14:20:33] <piotrektt> f.e sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[14:20:38] <praveenkumar> elita15: using superuser, yes
[14:20:39] <rahulch> elita15, go to su mode and do "cd root"
[14:20:42] <umesh> kushal, thank you
[14:20:56] <tenstormavi> kushal, i want to know the answer of the last question that was asked by prikotiyal.
[14:21:23] <umesh> praveenkumar, piotrektt , how to get in gui su mode?
[14:21:35] <prikotiyal> kushal: me too
[14:21:42] <praveenkumar> umesh: please google it.
[14:21:49] <kushal> prikotiyal, tenstormavi if you do not delete it then your hard drive might become full and then your computer will stop working
[14:21:55] <umesh> praveenkumar, ok thank you
[14:22:06] <J_Caselles> !
[14:22:13] <kushal> J_Caselles, ask
[14:22:24] <J_Caselles> isn't tmp automatically deleted?
[14:22:30] <kushal> J_Caselles, yes
[14:22:43] <iowa_kirk> umesh:  an example to launch a nautilus gui in super user would be to type "sudo nautilus" then enter password
[14:22:44] <prikotiyal> kushal: ok ,thank you
[14:22:45] <kushal> J_Caselles, they just don't want to :D
[14:22:50] <siddhant> kushal,then how deleting tmp files recommendation depends upon os
[14:22:54] <J_Caselles> :D xD
[14:22:55] <tenstormavi> kushal, but since i installed fedora i din't delete them but it is working properly.
[14:23:15] <iam_sudip> sudo pluma
[14:23:22] turB0gears is now known as SG
[14:23:28] <iam_sudip> then enter you password umesh
[14:23:32] <kushal> siddhant, when you will learn about os design and differences you will learn this also
[14:23:47] <piotrektt> tenstormavi, read the sentence "it might" which if you check in dictionary does not mean it will

[14:24:57] <elita15> is it possible to recover password required to get into superuser mode incase you lost it?
[14:25:07] <umesh> iowa_kirk, thank you
[14:25:12] <kushal> elita15, in general, the answer is no
[14:25:44] <iowa_kirk> umesh:  just type the gui application with sudo or gksudo
[14:25:48] <Christina> !
[14:25:55] <kushal> Christina, ask
[14:26:14] <umesh> iowa_kirk, ok let me try
[14:26:22] <Christina> what can be done in case we lose the super user password.
[14:26:32] <Christina> <EOF>
[14:26:44] <elita15> kushal,  actually i am sure the password is right, but i am getting an error authentication failed. do i have any option or do i have to reinstall ubuntu?
[14:26:50] <korak> kushal,in the terminal i wrote cd/ and it displayed  bash : cd/: no such file or directory ,what is the problem?
[14:27:07] <tutum> korak,its cd /
[14:27:09] <kushal> korak, type ancddf
[14:27:12] <prikotiyal> korak: use a space after cd
[14:27:15] <fewcha> korak: cd /
[14:27:15] <lakshya_> i will be cd /
[14:27:17] <lakshya_> korak
[14:27:20] <praveenkumar> elita15: what command you are executing?
[14:27:21] <elita15> <eof>
[14:27:30] <tutum> korak:cd<space>/
[14:27:35] <kushal> elita15, if you are reinstalling then you can install Fedora this time :D
[14:27:47] <elita15> praveenkumar, su
[14:27:52] <kushal> Christina, generally format and reinstall
[14:28:13] <praveenkumar> elita15: try "sudo su" and then provide the password.
[14:28:19] <ravi_pro> !
[14:28:25] <kushal> ravi_pro, ask
[14:28:30] <piotrektt> elita15, you can recover your password but it's complicated. you need to log in single-user mode
[14:28:49] <piotrektt> elita15, google it and decide if you like to reinstall or use the single user mode
[14:29:04] <fewcha> +1 kushal :D
[14:29:27] <ravi_pro> after installing fedora16 i got error like GRUB, and it is not opening either fedora nor windows
[14:29:31] <Christina> kushal, but in case i am using .iso then nothing can be done isnt it ?
[14:29:32] <ravi_pro> <eof>
[14:29:53] <ravi_pro> kushal,after installing fedora16 i got error like GRUB, and it is not opening either fedora nor windows
[14:30:04] <dot|not> ravi_pro, Fedora 16 is outdated!
[14:30:21] <praveenkumar> ravi_pro: use updated version
[14:30:30] <piotrektt> ravi_pro and this can be really so many different issues. it's hard to diagnose with single wod - GRUB
[14:30:34] <kushal> ravi_pro, also it seems you did some mistake while installing
[14:30:39] <elita15> kushal,piotrektt, praveenkumar , sudo su command with password worked, but i still did not understand why su  command with password failed.
[14:30:54] <piotrektt> elita15, oh you are in ubuntu
[14:30:59] <praveenkumar> elita15: ubuntu specific
[14:30:59] <kushal> elita15, now use passwd command to change superuser password
[14:31:06] <piotrektt> elita15, in ubuntu su does not work. there is no root user at all
[14:31:15] <kushal> oh
[14:31:23] <kushal> even I never knew
[14:31:24] <puspita> !
[14:31:28] <piotrektt> there is speciall layer called sudo that enables you to become root
[14:31:28] <piotrektt> for short time
[14:31:29] <praveenkumar> piotrektt: correct
[14:31:40] dell_ is now known as PleaseSTART
[14:31:40] <kushal> puspita, ask
[14:31:42] <piotrektt> to have superuser account you need to create it. google it
[14:32:05] <dot|not> No, please don't.
[14:32:10] <dot|not> There is no need for a superuser account.
[14:32:43] divs_ is now known as divs
[14:32:45] <puspita> with passwd command password changes when using in terminal, but when i'm logging into the system it's taking the old password. how to change the log in password
[14:32:52] <puspita> ? <eof>
[14:33:15] <dot|not> With the passed command you change your password ..
[14:33:24] <dot|not> There is no "separate" login password.
[14:33:29] <kushal> puspita, ^^
[14:33:31] <elita15> !
[14:34:18] <praveenkumar> dot|not: s/passed/passwd
[14:34:51] <dot|not> praveenkumar, you forgot a "g" at the end but you are right, thanks.
[14:34:54] <puspita> dot|not  previously i changed my password using passwd command.
[14:35:29] <sankha> !
[14:35:47] <praveenkumar> dot|not: 'g' is used for globally changed and in your line passed only once so no need :)
[14:35:48] <puspita> dot|not but that only worked with the terminal. When i'm logging in its still taking the old password.
[14:36:15] <kushal> samikshan, elita15 ask
[14:36:25] <kushal> sankha, elita15 ask
[14:36:36] <dot|not> praveenkumar, I know. But you want to change my mistake globally. ;)
[14:36:54] <praveenkumar> oh ok.
[14:36:55] <dot|not> puspita, NO. "passed" works on your password, not just a single session. You must have make another mistake then.
[14:37:01] <pratikkumar> !
[14:37:02] <dot|not> *passwd
[14:37:03] <dot|not> ARGS.
[14:37:20] <sankha> 'sudo su' password ans 'su' password are same or not ?  when i am trying to become superuser 'sudo su ' is working. 'su' command is showing authentication failure
[14:37:23] <elita15> what is the command to change the password of superuser ? and why is ubuntu better than fedora just incase i want to reinstall?
[14:37:37] <dot|not> sankha, which distribution do you use?
[14:37:46] <puspita> dot|not ok thanks
[14:37:47] <sankha> ubuntu 12.04
[14:37:50] <piotrektt> snkha, please look up. the question was answered already few minutes ago
[14:37:53] <kushal> sankha, ^^ read the above log, someone already answered that
[14:37:54] <dot|not> elita15: It would be passed root, but because there is no superuser on Linux, this won't work.
[14:38:01] <dot|not> sankha: Ubuntu has NO superuser.
[14:38:07] <dot|not> Therefore this does not work.
[14:38:10] divs is now known as devyani
[14:38:12] <praveenkumar> sankha: we already discussed it, scroll over.
[14:38:13] <tenstormavi> elita15, fedora is better.
[14:38:33] <piotrektt> tenstormavi, please don't start trash talk
[14:38:35] <kushal> elita15, nothing about better, Fedora is more developer friendly
[14:38:40] <bpcse> in ubuntu sudo can covert to super user
[14:38:45] <tenstormavi> piotrektt, ok
[14:38:52] <praveenkumar> tenstormavi: well it's user prospective. don't troll.
[14:39:00] <kushal> pratikkumar, ask
[14:39:19] <elita15> kushal,dot_not , thanks
[14:39:22] <pratikkumar> how can we restore a removed filed using command?
[14:39:36] <kushal> pratikkumar, you can not, simple :D
[14:39:39] <dot|not> pratikkumar, that's not done easily.
[14:39:48] <dot|not> So for now: You can't do that.
[14:39:52] <shantanu> pratikkumar, you should use it wisely
[14:39:57] <praveenkumar> use rm command carefully.
[14:40:20] <piotrektt> when you use rm command its good practice to run rm -i  it will ask you again then
[14:40:45] <kushal> is there anymore question ?
[14:41:02] <anurag> !
[14:41:37] <kushal> anurag, ask
[14:41:45] <sankha> piotrektt, superuser and root user are different ?
[14:41:49] <pratikkumar> <praveenkumar><piotrektt>, kushal, shantanu ok
[14:42:07] <anurag> coming from windows format, i still use mouse to remove files/dir, copy etc. should i more use the terminal for this ?
[14:42:10] <piotrektt> snkha, it's the same
[14:42:12] <umesh> !
[14:42:33] <kushal> umesh, ask
[14:42:43] <piotrektt> sankha, in linux terminology root is a superuser. but both terms are used.
[14:42:47] <kushal> anurag, yes, will help you in future
[14:42:53] <kushal> umesh, ask
[14:42:56] <m0rin09m`> !
[14:42:59] <elita15> !
[14:43:01] <kushal> m0rin09m`, ask
[14:43:29] <umesh> kushal, i can now login as root used the folling way http://fpaste.org/21029/
[14:43:43] <kushal> umesh, what is the question ?
[14:43:48] <kushal> elita15, ask
[14:43:48] <dot|not> Please don't do that umesh.
[14:43:56] <m0rin09m`> In between /dev/random and python random module, which pseudo-random generator generates more truly random number?
[14:44:15] <praveenkumar> umesh: listen to dot|not
[14:44:31] <elita15> i used  sudo su command to get into root mode  then tried to access  home directory of root account but it was empty, why is it so?
[14:44:32] <sankha> piotrektt, "sudo su " ans 'su' -  both are used to become superuser . 'su' doesnt work in ubuntu but 'sudo su ' does.'su' is for other distro .  am i correct ?
[14:44:36] <umesh> kushal, to become super user in gui mode
[14:44:44] <dot|not> elita15, because there are no files there by default.
[14:44:45] <m0rin09m`> <EOF>
[14:44:52] <dot|not> ls -a should show you some configuration files.
[14:44:59] <umesh> dot|not, praveenkumar ok
[14:46:15] <kushal> m0rin09m`, I don't know, but still now I saw all people using random module if they are using python
[14:46:28] <pratikkumar> !
[14:46:40] <elita15> dot_not, thanks.
[14:46:41] <m0rin09m`> kushal, ok. thanks
[14:46:56] <piotrektt> sankha, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=super+user+in+ubuntu
[14:46:56] <kushal> pratikkumar, thanks
[14:47:17] <pratikkumar> actually in the log,its written that lost+found folder keeps some files that may get deleted.so files cannot be restored from there?
[14:47:40] <tutum> pratikkumar.+1
[14:47:48] <kushal> pratikkumar, when you use rm, it just gets deleted
[14:47:58] <dot|not> Lost + found is for another purpose.
[14:47:59] <dot|not> Google it.
