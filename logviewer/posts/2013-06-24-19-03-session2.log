[19:32:21] <piotrektt> zishan, the concept is that you can create a wiki for your project, like wikipedia.org - but it's a private wiki visible only for you and members of the project (or public if you wish so)

[19:33:20] <PleaseSTART> actually i was bit late. can u tell me the topic that u r discussing??
[19:33:28] <PleaseSTART> <EOF>
[19:34:01] <pratikkumar> *social
[19:34:03] <kushal> Armageddon, yes, we don't have a problem , but it is better first one ask for permission to answering and then answer
[19:34:20] <Sudip> Kushal:thanks.
[19:34:28] <dot|not> This is rather an appeal than a question: I know, lots of things are now, I know some things may be confusing. But I would love people to stick to the rules and the netiquette and calm down instead of furiosly typing. Also: Some questions may have been already answered at some point or another - like in the guide we saw in the last lesson, good questions mean doing some recherche on the forehand.
[19:34:44] <kushal> dot|not, thanks
[19:34:44] <Armageddon> kushal, but that would be ! then can I asnwer, then go ahead and that would be after answering it... Can we use for example ? to request answering questions ?
[19:34:45] <dot|not> So please, think about that, this would reduce chaos immensely. Thank you. <EOF>
[19:34:52] <dot|not> *new
[19:35:16] <kushal> pratikkumar, say you created a new account to facebook and after login in it asks your gmail username/password so that it can find friends for you

[19:35:48] <kushal> pratikkumar, so you are giving your password to random social networking site

[19:51:06] <kushal> sankha87, continue, you don't have to pay any fine, no one is stopping you
[19:51:16] <dot|not> Again, not exactly a question about the topic: There are several questions now, and there will be further ones, that come up repeatedly - for example about setting up plaintext mails .. wouldn't it be easier for the instructors to make a simple infopage, maybe only pointing to the official documenation, so you can spare yourself the repeated work.
[19:51:19] <dot|not> <EOF>

[20:05:43] pritha_ is now known as tutum
[20:05:59] <kushal> btw, from today's questions it seems many of you never read http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:06:05] <kushal> read that
[20:06:09] <kushal> READ THAT
[20:06:32] <kushal> ^^ now someone tell me what line in capital letters means ?
[20:06:37] <dot|not> Shouting.
[20:06:44] <arin> Shouting
[20:06:46] <prikotiyal> shouting
[20:06:48] <dot|not> It's generally considered as rude behaviour.
[20:06:52] <shantanu> shouting
[20:06:55] <tutum> Shouting..
[20:06:57] <anurag> shouting
[20:07:00] <kushal> ok,
[20:07:10] <elita15> shouting
[20:07:12] <kushal> so few people read that link it seems
[20:07:17] <J_Caselles3> I would suggest to keep with the course planning, and don't lower the level, though some of us will have to work harder googling
[20:07:19] <pratikkumar> Shouting
[20:07:19] <rahulmishra> shouting
[20:07:25] <dot|not> !

[20:08:18] <siddhant> very important to do
[20:08:21] <aanchal> shouting
[20:08:28] <Sudip> shouting
[20:08:33] <shalini> shouting
[20:08:36] <Armageddon> kushal, why are you shouting at us ? :/
[20:08:54] <dot|not> Because some of us obviously haven't done their homework (Sorry for interrupting.)
[20:09:18] <kushal> J_Caselles3, yes, but in general the course starts with beginner friendly and slowly it will increase
[20:09:35] <kushal> dot|not, thanks :)
[20:09:43] <kushal> dot|not, you have any question ?
[20:10:11] <lakshya> kushal: ping, pm?
[20:10:20] <dot|not> Yes. If I need to regularly leave during the classes, should I tell it once, should I tell it everytime _before_ the class starts or at the exact point when I need to leave? <EOF>
[20:10:40] <kushal> lakshya, please wait till the session finishes
[20:10:47] <J_Caselles3> I mean don't be afraid of kicking us out if we don't do our homework... :P
[20:10:48] <lakshya> kushal: okay
[20:10:52] <kushal> dot|not, just once mentioning it will do
[20:11:03] <kushal> J_Caselles3, hehe :D
[20:11:22] <kushal> for the command line basics read http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/
[20:11:32] <dot|not> kushal: Thanks. So, let me mention it: I'll have to leave regularly for heading home in the middle of the class. Please just ignore me leaving and be assured that it has nothing to do with the class.
[20:11:43] <kushal> dot|not, no problem
[20:13:32] <suman> !
[20:14:29] <kushal> everyone please read http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/
[20:14:45] <kushal> before coming to next class
[20:14:45] <tenstormavi> ok
[20:14:51] <prikotiyal> ok
[20:14:52] <arin> ok
[20:14:54] <shantanu> ok
[20:14:56] <korak> ok
[20:15:02] <aanchal> ok
[20:15:02] <kushal> if it means you have to stay awake whole night, stay awake and do it
[20:15:03] <rahulmishra> ok
[20:15:08] <tutum> ok
[20:15:10] <shalini> ok
[20:15:11] <puja_> ok
[20:15:13] <bidisha> ok
[20:15:33] <kushal> you don't have to say ok everytime unless the mentor asks for it
[20:17:04] <kushal> also remember to stay online in IRC, if you just come for session time you are missing the major point of community
[20:17:26] <kushal> it is not only about learning, it is lot of fun too
[20:18:01] <Christina> !
[20:18:50] <kushal> suman, Christina ask
[20:18:56] <Zubin> kushal, +1.
[20:19:02] <suman>  should it necessary  to read all that link given during the class? <eof>
[20:19:05] <Christina> i use IRC by using the following link http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=dgplug is it ok
[20:19:28] <tanvi> !
[20:19:43] <Christina> or do i have to download something like xchat
[20:19:50] <Christina> <EOF>
[20:20:12] <kushal> suman, no, most of the links are to be read after the session, they are the homework
[20:20:32] <kushal> Christina, xchat is better option
[20:20:36] <kushal> tanvi, ask
[20:20:44] <tanvi> what does shell user means?
[20:21:08] <kushal> tanvi, means the user account in that computer to access the shell/terminal/console
[20:21:27] <tanvi> thank you
[20:22:12] <Armageddon> I have weechat running in tmux on a shell
[20:22:35] <Armageddon> I can leave and I will stay connected here and see what happened in my absence
[20:22:56] <kushal> Armageddon, we try not to confuse people with many options :)
[20:23:03] <kushal> any more question ?
[20:23:20] shantanu_ is now known as shantanu
[20:23:50] <kushal> tomorrow
[20:24:05] <Armageddon> kushal, tanvi asked and I explained it easily, configuring it is a different question :p
[20:24:32] <kushal> tomorrow's session will be from 6:30pm, mostly Questions and answers related today's links
[20:25:56] <piotrektt> !
[20:26:00] <kushal> piotrektt, ask
